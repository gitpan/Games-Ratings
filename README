Games-Ratings version 0.0.3

This is Games::Ratings, a module to calculate ratings for chess or
other games. At the moment one can calculate two different kinds of
chess ratings: FIDE ratings (aka "FIDE Elo") and German DWZ.
Furthermore calculation of go ratings (EGF) is provided. For more
informations see POD of:
* Games::Ratings
* Games::Ratings::Chess::FIDE
* Games::Ratings::Chess::DWZ
* Games::Ratings::Go::EGF

Warning!

This is the first module I wrote. Certainly it can be improved in
